# Tyep Casting:In Python, type casting refers to the process of converting a variable 
# from one data type to another. This is also known as type conversion. 
# Python provides several built-in functions for type casting, 
# allowing you to convert variables from one data type to another.

# Explain With Example:1

num_str = "123"
print(num_str)
print(type(num_str))

# Converent interger:

num_int = int(num_str)
print(num_int)
print(type(num_int))

# Example no:2

# This is string value
str1 = "20"
str2 = "45"
# srting value converet interger number

print(int(str1)+int(str2))
